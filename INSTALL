The software for the Latero device is divided into libraries and programs. The latero library (this project) consists of the core low-level drivers to control the Latero device.

This release of the sofware has been tested on Mac OS X Maverick and Yosemite and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Please follow these instructions. If you've successfully built and run this software on another platform, please list the steps you followed below.

Linux
*****

The following steps were tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

1. Make sure that your system is up to date:
>> sudo apt update

2. Install dependencies:
>> sudo apt install cmake libboost-all-dev

3. Compile and install the library:
>> cmake .
>> make
>> sudo make install

MAC OS X
*********

Step 1: Install MacPorts
--------------------------
If you already have MacPorts installed, skip to Step 2. Download Macports from https://www.macports.org/install.php. You might first need to install xcode and its command line developer tools.

Step 2: Install dependencies
-----------------------------
Most of the necessary dependencies can be installed using MacPorts. In order to enable SVG support in Gdk::Pixbuf, the "librsvg" package must installed.
>> port install cmake boost ImageMagick gtkmm libxmlxx2 librsvg

Step 3: Download, build and install the audiere library
---------------------------------------------------------
There is no port for the audiere library.
-- Download audiere (Unix Source Release 1.9.4): http://audiere.sourceforge.net/download.php
-- Add the following line in the file audiere-1.9.4/src/utility.h:   #include <stdlib.h>
   Without it, you won't be able to build audiere.
>> ./configure
>> make
>> sudo make install

Step 4: Install the latero library
-----------------------------------
You can use cmake to generate Xcode projects.
>> cmake . -G Xcode
>> xcodebuild -target latero
>> sudo xcodebuild -target install

or

>> cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles"
>> make
>> sudo make install

If the installation is successful, the library liblatero.a will now be in /usr/local/lib/ and the include files in /usr/local/include/latero

You can run the program latero-gui (another project) to test the library and latero device.


Cygwin (On windows or linux)
********************
Step 1: Install Cygwin
--------------------------
If you already have Cygwin installed, skip to Step 2. Download Cygwin from https://www.cygwin.com/. you can see how install it from https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html. After installing the cygwin, don't delete setup-x86.exe (or setup-x86_64.exe). It will be used for step 2.


Step 2: Install dependency from cygwin installer
----------------------------------------------------
In order to bulld all of latero program, you need to install follow packages using setup-x86.exe (or setup-x86_64.exe)

-- cmake, cmake-doc, cmake-gui
-- wget, tar
-- doxygen
-- gcc-core, gcc-g++, gcc-objc, gcc-objc++
-- libMagick-devel, libMagickC++, libMagickCore, libMagickWand
-- libgtkmm2.4-devel, libgtkmm2.4-doc,libgtkmm2.4_1
-- libxml++2.6-devel, libxml++2.6-_2, libxml2-devel, libxml2
-- librsvg2-devel, librsvg2_2

Step 3: Install boost library
----------------------------------------------------

>> wget 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0.tar.gz'
>> tar xvzf boost_1.60_0.tar.gz
>> cd ./boost_1_60_0
>> ./bootstrap.sh
>> ./b2
>> cmake .
>> make
>> make install

Step 4: Install latero
----------------------------------------------------
>> cd {direcry path to latero library}
>> cmake .
>> make
>> sudo make install


If the installation is successful, the library liblatero.a will now be in /usr/local/lib/ and the include files in /usr/local/include/latero

You can run the program latero-gui (another project) to test the library and latero device.
